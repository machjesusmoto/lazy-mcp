## 📄 Task 4.1: README Accuracy Check

### Installation Instructions ✅
- [x] npm install command correct and up-to-date
- [x] Node.js version requirement matches package.json (>=18.0.0)
- [x] Global installation instructions accurate (`npm install -g mcp-toggle`)
- [x] npx alternative documented (`npx mcp-toggle`)
- [x] Local development setup complete (npm install, build, test, lint)

**Status**: ✅ **ACCURATE** - All installation instructions verified correct

### Usage Instructions ✅
- [x] Command examples work as documented
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts match implementation:
  - `↑/↓` or `k/j` - Navigate (CORRECT)
  - `Tab` - Switch between panels (CORRECT)
  - `Space` - Toggle blocked state (CORRECT)
  - `Enter` - Save changes (CORRECT)
  - `q` or `Esc` - Quit (CORRECT)
- [x] TUI layout ASCII art accurate and representative
- [x] --no-claude-md flag documented

**Status**: ✅ **ACCURATE** - All usage instructions verified

### Features List ✅
- [x] v0.4.2 features present:
  - Unified list (servers, memory, agents) ✅
  - Token estimation display (cyan/bold) ✅
  - Visual enhancements (selection contrast) ✅
  - Viewport scrolling fix (implicit in v0.4.2, not prominently featured in README)
- [x] Migration feature documented (v0.4.0 migration-v0.4.0.md referenced)
- [x] No outdated features listed

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - All major features documented. v0.4.2 viewport fix is in CHANGELOG/RELEASE_NOTES, which is appropriate for bug fix releases.

### Configuration ✅
- [x] .mcp.json structure documented (DEPRECATED - removed in v0.2.0+)
- [x] settings.json structure documented (v0.4.0 permissions.deny format)
- [x] settings.json integration explained (Native Claude Code mechanism)
- [x] File locations accurate (.claude/ directory structure)

**Status**: ✅ **ACCURATE** - Configuration documentation matches v0.4.0+ implementation

**Note**: README still mentions `.mcp.json` in "How It Works" section (line 113-122), but this is **historical context** and correctly notes the migration to `settings.json` in later sections. No correction needed.
