# ‚úÖ Phase 1 Foundation - COMPLETE

*Completed: 2025-10-12*

## Success Confirmation

All Phase 1 tasks from `AI_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` have been successfully implemented and tested.

### ‚úÖ What Works

**Slash Commands** (Verified working):
- `/toggle.help` - Shows help, features, and roadmap
- `/toggle.version` - Shows version 2.0.0 and release history
- `/toggle.status` - Shows Phase 1 stub (full implementation in Phase 2)

**Monorepo Structure**:
- Root package.json configured with workspaces
- plugin/, cli/, shared/ directories created
- TypeScript configurations in all workspaces
- Successful build with no errors

**Plugin Infrastructure**:
- plugin/src/index.ts with proper exports
- plugin/src/hooks/session-start.ts (stub for Phase 2)
- plugin/src/commands/index.ts (TypeScript command definitions)
- .claude/commands/*.md (Markdown slash commands)

### üìã Important Usage Requirement

**Commands only work when Claude Code is launched from project root**:

```bash
# ‚úÖ Correct - Commands work
cd /home/dtaylor/motodev/projects/mcp_toggle
claude

# ‚ùå Wrong - Commands won't be found
cd /home/dtaylor/motodev/projects/mcp_toggle/plugin
claude
```

**Why**: Claude Code loads slash commands from `.claude/commands/` relative to the launch directory. When launched from a subdirectory, it won't find the parent directory's commands.

### üîß Technical Details

**Command Format Learned**:
- Files must be in `.claude/commands/`
- Naming convention: Use dots not hyphens (e.g., `toggle.help.md` not `toggle-help.md`)
- Format: Markdown with frontmatter containing `description` field
- Commands load at Claude Code startup

**Two Plugin Systems**:
1. **Slash Commands** (Markdown) - Immediate, no restart needed
   - Location: `.claude/commands/*.md`
   - ‚úÖ Implemented in Phase 1

2. **Plugin Hooks** (TypeScript) - Requires restart, programmatic
   - Location: `~/.claude/plugins/`
   - üöß Will be used in Phase 2 for SessionStart and PreToolUse hooks

### üìä Success Criteria Met

- [x] Monorepo structure created and building
- [x] Package.json files in all workspaces
- [x] TypeScript configurations working
- [x] Slash commands created and verified
- [x] Basic plugin infrastructure in place
- [x] Documentation complete

### üéØ Ready for Phase 2

Phase 1 Foundation is complete. The project is ready to proceed to:

**Phase 2: Core Services & Enumeration**
- Implement actual context enumeration
- Read .claude.json for MCP servers
- Scan .claude/memories/ for memory files
- Discover available agents
- Calculate token estimates
- Build real /toggle.status command

### üêõ Issues Encountered & Resolved

1. **Issue**: Commands not recognized
   - **Cause**: Wrong naming convention (hyphens vs dots)
   - **Fix**: Renamed to `toggle.help.md`, `toggle.version.md`, `toggle.status.md`

2. **Issue**: Commands not loading from subdirectory
   - **Cause**: Claude Code loads commands relative to launch directory
   - **Fix**: Documented requirement to run from project root

3. **Issue**: Thought commands needed TypeScript exports
   - **Cause**: Misunderstanding of Claude Code plugin system
   - **Fix**: Created Markdown files in .claude/commands/

### üìö Documentation Created

- `/home/dtaylor/motodev/projects/mcp_toggle/docs/AI_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` - Full execution strategy
- `/home/dtaylor/motodev/projects/mcp_toggle/docs/LICENSE_ANALYSIS.md` - Legal clearance
- `/home/dtaylor/motodev/projects/mcp_toggle/PLUGIN_INSTALLATION.md` - Installation guide
- `/home/dtaylor/motodev/projects/mcp_toggle/TEST_COMMANDS.md` - Testing guide
- `/home/dtaylor/motodev/projects/mcp_toggle/PHASE_1_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` - Phase 1 report

### üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Human Approval**: Phase 1 testing complete - approve to proceed
2. **Phase 2 Start**: Begin implementation of core services
3. **Timeline**: Continue with 6-week roadmap

---

**Phase 1 Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE AND VERIFIED**

Commands are working as expected when launched from project root.
