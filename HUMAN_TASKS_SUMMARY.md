# Human Tasks Summary - mcp-toggle Development

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: COMPLETE - No Tasks Needed
Phase 1 is done! Commands work globally. You already tested and approved.

## ‚úÖ Phase 2: COMPLETE - No Tasks Needed
Phase 2 core enumeration is done! The shared library works and is tested.

## üîÑ Phase 3 & Beyond: What You'll Need To Do

### Upcoming Human Pause Points

#### üö¶ Pause Point 3.1: lazy-mcp Integration Testing (Phase 3)
**When**: After AI builds lazy-mcp integration
**Time required**: ~30 minutes

**Your tasks**:
1. Run `/toggle:configure-lazy-mcp` in Claude Code
2. Verify lazy-mcp config file created correctly
3. **Install voicetreelab/lazy-mcp** (if not already installed)
   - Note: We'll need to find this repository first (wasn't publicly available when we checked)
4. Test lazy-mcp with generated config
5. Verify tools load correctly through lazy-mcp
6. Report: ‚úÖ Works / ‚ùå Bugs found

**Special requirement**: Need access to voicetreelab/lazy-mcp repository

#### üö¶ Pause Point 4.1: Profile System Testing (Phase 4)
**When**: After AI builds profile management
**Time required**: ~20 minutes

**Your tasks**:
1. Create a test profile using `/toggle:save-profile my-test-profile`
2. Switch profiles: `/toggle:profile my-test-profile`
3. Verify profile loaded correctly (check context changed)
4. Test profile listing: `/toggle:list-profiles`
5. Report: ‚úÖ Works / ‚ùå Bugs found

---

#### üö¶ Pause Point 5.1: Migration Script Testing (Phase 5)
**When**: After AI builds CLI‚ÜíPlugin migration
**Time required**: ~30 minutes

**Your tasks**:
1. If you have old mcp-toggle CLI config, back it up
2. Run migration script: `npm run migrate`
3. Verify settings migrated correctly
4. Test that old CLI blocking rules work in plugin
5. Report: ‚úÖ Works / ‚ùå Bugs found

---

#### üö¶ Pause Point 6.1: Marketplace Submission (Phase 6)
**When**: After AI completes final polish
**Time required**: ~1 hour

**Your tasks**:
1. Review final documentation
2. Test complete workflow end-to-end
3. **Submit to Claude Code marketplace** (AI can't do this)
   - Package plugin
   - Create marketplace listing
   - Submit for review
4. Handle any marketplace feedback

---

## Current Status: Ready for Phase 3

You don't need to do anything right now! AI will:
1. Build Phase 3 (lazy-mcp integration) - fully automated
2. Build Phase 4 (profile system) - fully automated
3. Build Phase 5 (migration) - fully automated
4. Build Phase 6 (polish) - fully automated

Then you'll test at each pause point.

## Total Human Time Required

| Phase | Your Time | What You Do |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Phase 1 ‚úÖ | 0 min | Already done |
| Phase 2 ‚úÖ | 0 min | Already done |
| Phase 3 | ~30 min | Test lazy-mcp integration |
| Phase 4 | ~20 min | Test profile system |
| Phase 5 | ~30 min | Test migration |
| Phase 6 | ~60 min | Marketplace submission |
| **Total** | **~2.5 hours** | Testing & submission |

## Next Steps

**Option 1: Continue with Phase 3 Now**
I can build lazy-mcp integration, profile system, and migration - all without your help. You'll test later.

**Option 2: Pause Here**
We stop here. You test Phase 2 when ready, then come back for Phase 3.

**Option 3: Build Everything**
I build Phases 3-6 completely, then you do all testing in one session (~2.5 hours).

## Blockers to Note

1. **voicetreelab/lazy-mcp access**: We couldn't find this repository publicly. Alternatives:
   - Use TBXark/mcp-proxy (parent project) instead
   - Build our own simple lazy loader
   - Skip lazy-mcp integration (Phase 3) for now

2. **Marketplace submission**: Requires your human account/authentication

Everything else can be built by AI completely autonomously!

## Recommendation

**Build Phases 3-6 now** while you have AI available. You can test everything in one 2.5-hour session later. This maximizes AI usage and minimizes context switching.
