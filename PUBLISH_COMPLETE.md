## Issues Resolved During Publication

### 1. Jest Configuration Error
- **Issue**: Plugin tests failed due to non-existent `tests/` directory in jest.config.js
- **Fix**: Updated `roots` array to only include `<rootDir>/src`
- **File**: `plugin/jest.config.js`

### 2. TypeScript Module Resolution
- **Issue**: Plugin couldn't find `@lazy-mcp/shared` during build
- **Fix**:
  - Changed build order to sequential: shared â†’ cli â†’ plugin
  - Added `composite: true` to plugin tsconfig
  - Changed plugin build script to `tsc --build`
- **Files**: `package.json`, `plugin/tsconfig.json`, `plugin/package.json`

### 3. NPM Provenance Validation
- **Issue**: Provenance validation failed due to missing repository field
- **Fix**: Added repository field to shared/package.json and plugin/package.json
- **Files**: `shared/package.json`, `plugin/package.json`

### 4. Stale Build Cache
- **Issue**: Local builds failed even after fixes due to stale `.tsbuildinfo` files
- **Fix**: Removed tsbuildinfo files before building
- **Note**: GitHub Actions uses fresh environment, so no issue there

## GitHub Actions Workflow

The automated publish workflow is configured and working:
- **Location**: `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
- **Trigger**: Manual workflow dispatch or release creation
- **Steps**: Checkout â†’ Install â†’ Build â†’ Test â†’ Publish (with provenance)
- **Duration**: ~2-3 minutes

## Next Steps for Future Releases

1. **Bump versions** in all three package.json files
2. **Commit changes**: `git commit -am "chore: bump version to X.Y.Z"`
3. **Create release**: `gh release create vX.Y.Z --generate-notes`
4. **Automatic publish**: GitHub Actions will handle the rest
