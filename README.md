Intelligent lazy-loading for Claude Code MCP tools. Let the agent decide what tools to load based on usage patterns and context needs.

## Overview

Lazy MCP is a Claude Code plugin that enables **agent-driven tool loading** with intelligent context optimization. Instead of loading all available MCP servers upfront (consuming precious context window space), Lazy MCP uses a registry-based approach to inform Claude about available tools and loads them on-demand based on your actual needs.

**What It Does**:
- **Agent-Driven Loading**: Claude intelligently requests tools based on conversation analysis
- **Registry-Informed**: Maintains a registry of tool capabilities, keywords, and usage patterns
- **Lazy Loading**: Tools are loaded only when needed, then purged when usage ceases
- **Context Optimization**: Automatically manages context window to prevent limitations
- **Profile Support**: Save and switch between different tool configurations

## The Problem

Traditional MCP integration loads all configured servers at session start, quickly consuming your context window with tools you may never use in a particular conversation. This leads to:
- Frequent context limit errors
- Wasted tokens on unused tool definitions
- Poor agent performance due to context clutter

## The Solution

Lazy MCP uses a **registry + lazy loading** approach:

1. **Registry**: Maintains metadata about all available tools (capabilities, keywords, usage patterns)
2. **Agent Analysis**: Claude analyzes your request and identifies potentially useful tools
3. **On-Demand Loading**: Only requested tools are loaded into context
4. **Intelligent Purging**: Tools are removed when usage patterns indicate they're no longer needed
5. **Persistent Learning**: Usage patterns improve tool selection over time

## Installation

### As Claude Code Plugin

```bash
# Install the plugin package
npm install -g lazy-mcp

# The plugin will be automatically detected by Claude Code
# Commands will be available as /lazy:* in your sessions
```

### As Standalone CLI

```bash
# Global installation
npm install -g @lazy-mcp/cli

# Or use with npx (no installation)
npx @lazy-mcp/cli
```

## Usage

### Plugin Commands

Once installed, use these commands in any Claude Code session:

```bash
/lazy:status          # Show current loaded tools and context usage
/lazy:help            # Show all available commands
/lazy:version         # Show version information
```

### Workflow

1. **Start Session**: Lazy MCP analyzes available tools and creates a registry
2. **Work Naturally**: Ask Claude to help with your tasks
3. **Automatic Loading**: Claude identifies needed tools from registry and loads them
4. **Context Monitoring**: Tools are automatically purged when no longer needed
5. **Save Profiles**: Capture successful configurations for reuse

## Features

### Core Capabilities

- ðŸ§  **Agent-Driven**: Claude decides what tools to load based on conversation analysis
- ðŸ“š **Registry System**: Maintains comprehensive tool metadata and usage patterns
- âš¡ **Lazy Loading**: Load tools on-demand, purge when finished
- ðŸŽ¯ **Context Optimization**: Intelligent management of context window space
- ðŸ’¾ **Profile Support**: Save and switch between tool configurations
- ðŸ”— **Seamless Integration**: Works within Claude Code plugin system

### Runtime Blocking

When tools are disabled/blocked:
- PreToolUse hook prevents execution
- Clear user feedback with enable instructions
- No token waste on blocked tool calls

## Architecture

### Plugin System Integration

```
Claude Code Session
    â†“
SessionStart Hook â†’ Load registry, analyze available tools
    â†“
User Request â†’ Claude analyzes needs
    â†“
Agent Decision â†’ Request specific tools
    â†“
Lazy Loading â†’ Load only requested tools

```

### Registry Structure

```typescript
{
  "tool-name": {
    "capabilities": ["search", "documentation"],
    "keywords": ["docs", "api", "reference"],
    "usagePattern": "documentation-lookup",
    "avgTokens": 2500,
    "contextPriority": "medium"
  }
}
```
