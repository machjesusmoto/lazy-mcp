# mcp-toggle: Next Steps & Action Items
*Last Updated: 2025-10-12*
*Status: Planning Complete ‚Üí Awaiting Approval*

## üéØ Current Status

**Planning Phase**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
- Research, architecture, requirements, and roadmap all documented
- 200+ pages of comprehensive planning materials
- Strategic decision to integrate with voicetreelab/lazy-mcp
- 6-phase implementation plan (7 weeks) ready to execute

**Key Question for You**: Do you approve the integration approach with voicetreelab/lazy-mcp?

## üìã Quick Decision Required

### Integration Strategy Approval

**Recommendation**: Use voicetreelab/lazy-mcp as the registry component

**Rationale**:
- ‚úÖ Production-ready, proven solution (95% context reduction)
- ‚úÖ Don't duplicate effort - focus on unique value
- ‚úÖ Faster time to market
- ‚úÖ Collaborative open-source ecosystem

**What mcp-toggle will focus on**:
1. Memory file management (lazy-mcp doesn't have)
2. Agent management (lazy-mcp doesn't have)
3. Profile system for workflows (lazy-mcp doesn't have)
4. User-friendly Claude Code integration (TUI/slash commands)
5. Configuration simplification for lazy-mcp

**Your Approval Needed**:
- [ ] ‚úÖ **Approve**: Use lazy-mcp integration approach ‚Üí Proceed with implementation
- [ ] ‚ùå **Reject**: Build our own registry ‚Üí Update architecture and requirements
- [ ] ü§î **Discuss**: Need more information ‚Üí Review `/tmp/lazy-mcp-comparison.md`

## üöÄ If Approved: Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Review Documentation (30 minutes)
**Priority**: High | **Effort**: 30 minutes

Key documents to review:
- [ ] `docs/PLUGIN_CONVERSION_SUMMARY.md` - Overall plan summary
- [ ] `/tmp/lazy-mcp-comparison.md` - Overlap analysis and recommendation
- [ ] `docs/MIGRATION_ROADMAP.md` - 6-phase implementation plan
- [ ] `docs/requirements/INTEGRATION_STRATEGY.md` - lazy-mcp integration details

**Questions to consider**:
- Is the 7-week timeline realistic?
- Are the success metrics appropriate?
- Any concerns about the integration approach?
- Need clarification on any technical decisions?

### 2. Set Up Development Environment (1 hour)
**Priority**: High | **Effort**: 1 hour

```bash
# 1. Create monorepo structure
cd ~/motodev/projects/mcp_toggle
mkdir -p plugin cli shared

# 2. Install development dependencies
npm install --save-dev \
  @types/node \
  typescript \
  jest \
  @types/jest \
  ts-jest

# 3. Set up testing framework
npx ts-jest config:init

# 4. Create plugin manifest template
# (See docs/requirements/PLUGIN_REQUIREMENTS.md Section 2.1)
```

### 3. Explore voicetreelab/lazy-mcp (30 minutes)
**Priority**: High | **Effort**: 30 minutes

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/voicetreelab/lazy-mcp.git ~/lazy-mcp-explore
cd ~/lazy-mcp-explore

# 2. Review their architecture
cat README.md
cat docs/  # If available

# 3. Test their example configuration
# (Follow their setup instructions)

# 4. Document integration points
# - Configuration format
# - Tool organization structure
# - Command patterns
```

### 4. Begin Phase 1 Implementation (Week 1)
**Priority**: High | **Effort**: 1 week

**Week 1 Deliverables**:
- [ ] Plugin manifest (`package.json` with Claude Code fields)
- [ ] Monorepo structure (`plugin/`, `cli/`, `shared/`)
- [ ] Basic slash commands (`/toggle:help`, `/toggle:version`)
- [ ] SessionStart hook (enumerate context items)
- [ ] Unit test framework with >80% coverage

**Implementation Guide**: See `docs/MIGRATION_ROADMAP.md` Phase 1
