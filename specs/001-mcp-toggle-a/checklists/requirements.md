# Specification Quality Checklist: MCP Toggle

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Issues Found

None - all quality checks pass.

### Clarification Status

All [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers have been resolved:
- **Language/Platform**: Node.js/TypeScript selected for npm distribution and MCP ecosystem alignment
- **Installation Method**: npm package manager distribution for easy updates and dependency management

## Notes

- Overall specification quality is high with clear user stories, comprehensive requirements, and measurable success criteria
- Edge cases are well-defined
- The specification is appropriately technology-agnostic
- All clarifications resolved - **specification is ready for the planning phase** (`/speckit.plan`)
