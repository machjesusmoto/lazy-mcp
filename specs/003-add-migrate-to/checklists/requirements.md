# Specification Quality Checklist: Migrate to Global

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All checklist items validated

### Content Quality Assessment
- Specification avoids implementation details (no mention of TypeScript, React, Ink, specific file operations)
- Focuses on user experience and business value (unified blocking mechanism, preventing data loss)
- Written in plain language accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections present and complete (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete and actionable
- All 18 functional requirements are testable with clear pass/fail criteria
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (time in seconds, percentage, zero failures)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on user completion time, system reliability, user success rates)
- Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format for all user stories (12 scenarios total)
- Edge cases section covers 6 boundary conditions with expected behaviors
- Scope clearly bounded with "Out of Scope" section listing 9 excluded features
- Assumptions section documents 7 foundational assumptions
- Dependencies identified implicitly (fs-extra for JSON operations, atomic write pattern)

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios (FR-001 to US1-AS3, FR-003 to US2-AS1, etc.)
- User scenarios prioritized (P1: core migration, P2: selective, P3: validation/rollback)
- Success criteria align with user scenarios (SC-001/SC-004 for migration time, SC-002 for no data loss)
- No implementation leakage detected (no file system APIs, no library names, no code structure)

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- No clarifications needed from user
- All edge cases have defined expected behaviors
- Feature scope is well-bounded with clear exclusions
