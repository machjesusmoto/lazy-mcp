# Tasks: Actual MCP Server Blocking via .claude.json Modification

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-redesign-mcp-toggle/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (complete), spec.md (complete), research.md (complete), data-model.md (complete), contracts/ (complete)

**Execution Context**: Tasks will be executed by Claude Code (primary AI agent) with potential delegation to specialized sub-agents for complex operations.

**Tests**: Included - Test-Driven Development approach with existing Jest infrastructure (78 tests to update/extend).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, Setup, Foundation)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Project uses: `src/core/`, `src/models/`, `src/services/`, `src/ui/`, `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Prepare existing project for architectural redesign

- [ ] T001 [P] [Setup] Review and update TypeScript types in `src/models/types.ts` to include blocking metadata interfaces (ClaudeJsonConfig, MCPServerConfig, BlockedMCPServerConfig, UnblockResult, MigrationResult)
- [ ] T002 [P] [Setup] Update Jest configuration if needed for new test files (migration.test.ts, blocking-workflow.test.ts)
- [ ] T003 [P] [Setup] Create backup of existing v0.1.1 implementation (tag git commit as `v0.1.1-pre-redesign`)

**Checkpoint**: Project structure ready for foundational changes

---

- [ ] T011 [P] [Foundation] Implement `claudeJsonExists()` in `src/utils/claude-json-utils.ts` - Check file existence
- [ ] T012 [P] [Foundation] Implement `ensureClaudeJson()` in `src/utils/claude-json-utils.ts` - Create minimal config if missing
- [ ] T013 [Foundation] Write unit tests for all claude-json-utils functions in `tests/unit/claude-json-utils.test.ts` (atomic write, backup/restore, type guards, dummy override generation)
- [ ] T014 [Foundation] Update `src/models/types.ts` with all interfaces from data-model.md (ensure BlockedMCPServerConfig extends MCPServerConfig)
- [ ] T015 [Foundation] Update `loadMCPServers()` in `src/core/config-loader.ts` to detect and flag blocked servers (set isBlocked=true when _mcpToggleBlocked detected)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - **BLOCKS all user stories**
- **User Stories (Phase 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories CAN proceed in parallel (if multiple AI agents available)
  - OR sequentially in priority order: US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4 ‚Üí US5 ‚Üí US6 ‚Üí US7
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

**Independent Stories** (can be implemented in parallel after Foundation):
- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Block local servers - No dependencies
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Unblock local servers - Depends on US1 (needs blocking first)
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Block inherited servers - No dependencies on US1/US2
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Unblock inherited servers - Depends on US3 (needs inherited blocking first)
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Block memory files - No dependencies on US1-4
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: Unblock memory files - Depends on US5 (needs memory blocking first)
- **User Story 7 (P3)**: Migration - Depends on US1, US3, US5 (uses blocking functions)

**Recommended Order**:
1. US1 + US2 (local server blocking/unblocking) - Core MVP
2. US3 + US4 (inherited server blocking/unblocking) - Essential for multi-project
3. US5 + US6 (memory file blocking/unblocking) - Nice-to-have enhancement
4. US7 (migration) - Backward compatibility (can be done anytime after US1/US3/US5)

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD)
- Foundation utilities before blocking logic
- Blocking logic before TUI integration
- Core implementation before edge cases
- Story complete and tested before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 2 (Foundation)**: Tasks T009-T012 can run in parallel (different functions, no dependencies)

**Phase 3 (US1)**: Tests T016-T018 can run in parallel

**Phase 5 (US3)**: Tests T032-T034 can run in parallel

**Phase 7 (US5)**: Tests T047-T048 can run in parallel

**Phase 8 (US6)**: Tests T055-T057 can run in parallel

**Phase 9 (US7)**: Tests T062-T066 can run in parallel

**Phase 10 (Polish)**: Tasks T075-T084 can run in parallel (documentation, testing, edge cases)

**Multi-Agent Parallel Strategy** (if multiple AI agents available):
- After Foundation completes:
  - Agent 1: US1 + US2 (local blocking)
  - Agent 2: US3 + US4 (inherited blocking)
  - Agent 3: US5 + US6 (memory blocking)
  - Agent 4: US7 (migration - waits for 1/2/3)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (Claude Code with parallel tool calls):
Agent: "Write integration test 'block local server' in tests/integration/blocking-workflow.test.ts"
Agent: "Write integration test 'blocked local server doesn't load' in tests/integration/blocking-workflow.test.ts"
Agent: "Write unit test 'blockLocalServer removes config' in tests/unit/blocked-manager.test.ts"

# Results: 3 tests created, all should FAIL initially
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T015) - **CRITICAL - blocks all stories**
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T016-T025) - Block local servers
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T026-T031) - Unblock local servers
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1+US2 independently with real Claude Code
6. Decision point: Ship v2.0.0-beta OR continue to full feature set

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundation ‚Üí ~15 tasks ‚Üí **Foundation ready**
2. Add US1+US2 ‚Üí +16 tasks ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **MVP (local blocking)**
3. Add US3+US4 ‚Üí +15 tasks ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **v2.0.0-beta (inherited blocking)**
4. Add US5+US6 ‚Üí +14 tasks ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **Enhanced (memory management)**
5. Add US7 ‚Üí +13 tasks ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **Complete (backward compatible)**
6. Polish ‚Üí +14 tasks ‚Üí **v2.0.0 production ready**

### Parallel AI Agent Strategy

With multiple Claude Code instances or sub-agents:

1. **Single agent completes Setup + Foundation** (sequential, ~18 tasks)
2. Once Foundation done, **split user stories across agents**:
   - Primary Agent: US1+US2 (local blocking/unblocking)
   - Sub-Agent 1: US3+US4 (inherited blocking/unblocking)
   - Sub-Agent 2: US5+US6 (memory file management)
   - Sub-Agent 3: US7 (migration) - starts after others complete
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. **Merge and validate** with complete test suite
5. Final agent does Polish phase

**Estimated Task Count**: 88 tasks total
- Setup: 3 tasks
- Foundation: 12 tasks (BLOCKING)
- US1 (P1): 10 tasks
- US2 (P1): 6 tasks
- US3 (P2): 9 tasks
- US4 (P2): 6 tasks
- US5 (P3): 9 tasks
- US6 (P3): 7 tasks
- US7 (P3): 13 tasks
- Polish: 14 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities Identified**: 28 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
**Independent Test Criteria**: Each user story has 2-5 tests verifying independence

**Suggested MVP Scope**: User Story 1 + 2 (local server blocking/unblocking) = 16 implementation tasks + foundation

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files or independent functions, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **TDD approach**: Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group (use conventional commits)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Use Task tool to delegate complex multi-file operations to sub-agents
- Foundation phase (T004-T015) is CRITICAL - no user story work can proceed until complete
- Atomic writes with backup/restore prevent .claude.json corruption (SC-003)
- Performance targets: <2s blocking, <500ms memory ops (SC-002, SC-011)
