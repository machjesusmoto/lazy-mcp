# Specification Quality Checklist: Actual MCP Server Blocking via .claude.json Modification

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All validation criteria met

**Summary**:
- 7 user stories covering P1 (core blocking/unblocking), P2 (inherited servers), P3 (memory files + migration)
- 30 functional requirements with clear testable criteria
- 12 success criteria with measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes
- 10 edge cases identified with resolution strategies
- Comprehensive assumptions and out-of-scope documented
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are unambiguous

**Notes**:
- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- All user stories have independent test criteria and are properly prioritized
- Success criteria focus on user outcomes (enforcement, speed, reliability) not implementation
- Edge cases cover common failure scenarios (missing files, malformed JSON, concurrent access)
